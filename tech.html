                       <p>Science and technology have become essential aspects of our lives. Technology was a luxury at a point in time, but now it has become a necessity. It is impossible to survive without electricity, television, music systems, mobile phones, internet connections, etc. We start and end our day with technology. So it is indeed difficult to imagine our life without technology, but it should be used with caution. If we become too dependent on technology, it will end up being harmful to us and our health. Overuse of technology can also become self-destructive, so it is important everyone uses technology only when necessary.

Advanced technology has increased productivity across all fields of work.  Technology is our new present and future, and it has made life easier and more convenient for us. Humans have become more reliant on science and technology as a result of technological advancements. Every human activity has now been replaced by one created by machines. We rely on technology for every aspect of our lives, and it has become an inseparable element of our lives. </p>

                       <p>The use of contemporary technology has made the entire civilization reliant on it. Without technology, life and business would grind to a halt.
                       From the moment we open our eyes, we are surrounded by technology. The fans, lights, televisions, computers, induction stoves, etc. It is just not possible to move a step further without using technology. There was a time when people used to wait for months to receive a letter from their close ones. But now, we all are just a click away. If you are missing someone, you just have to click once for a video call or text message. The cost has also reduced with time. If you crave a piece of cake, then the microwave is the solution. If you are tired and unable to wash utensils, then a dishwasher is the solution. If you want to party, then the music system is the solution. Technology is the ultimate solution to every problem that a human being is facing, and scientists are so alert about the same that they come up with new and innovative solutions to every problem. It is, however, important that you do not completely rely on technology.</p>
